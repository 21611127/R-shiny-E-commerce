# Dashboard R-shiny-E-commerce
Study Case
You are working as a Data Analyst at an e-commerce company with operations across several Southeast Asian countries. You have been tasked with analyzing the factors that influence monthly sales volume. The data collected includes the following variables:
X1  = monthly sales volume (in thousand of USD),
X2  = number of website visitors per month,
X3  = average number of items per transaction,
X4  = customer satisfaction rating (scale 1-10),
X5  = number of online advertisements run per month.

Exam Instructions:
1. Using the provided data, estimate a multiple linear regression equation to predict the monthly sales volume (y) based on the given variables (x1 to x5).
2. Design a basic concept for an interactive dashboard using R Shiny that allows users to input predictor data (x1 to x5) and receive an estimate for sales.
3. Briefly discuss the methodology for evaluating the regression model you build, including tests for assumptions, significance testing of coefficients, and how you would interpret these coefficients.
4. How could the results from this model be used to improve marketing strategy and increase sales?
Additional Questions:
a. If the company wishes to increase sales, which variable should they focus on improving based on your model?
b. How can you check if there is a significant interaction between the number of website visitors and the number of ads run that affects sales?

This exam is designed to test students' abilities to apply multiple linear regression in a business context and understand the practical application of BI tools like R Shiny for interactive data visualization and decision-making.
